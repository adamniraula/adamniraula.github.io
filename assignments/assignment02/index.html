                <p>
                    Capybaras are the world’s largest rodents, easily recognized by their barrel-shaped bodies and webbed feet. Native to South America, they thrive along riverbanks and marshes where they graze on grasses and aquatic plants. These highly social mammals live in groups that can number up to 20 individuals, showing cooperation in keeping watch. Despite their size, capybaras are excellent swimmers and can stay submerged for up to five minutes.

                    Their eyes, ears, and nostrils sit high on their heads, allowing them to see and breathe while most of their body remains underwater. A capybara’s coat is coarse and water-resistant, helping them dry quickly after a dip. They communicate through a variety of whistles, grunts, and barks to maintain group cohesion. Gentle by nature, they often allow birds to pick ticks from their fur—a mutualistic behavior common in wetlands.
